# About

This is a standalone google map that displays 2 types of variables (count and sum) on an administrative area map of bandung. There is a UI that allows the user to switch between displaying those 2 variables.
The 2 variables were in json as a way to mock an API endpoint. This sample code that was eventually adapted and added to newbirms and the json replaced by a real api endpoint.

Since the map was a standalone deliverable that we said we'd deliver as part of component one, I am keeping this repo as archive and for reference for titan.
